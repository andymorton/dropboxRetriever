What is this app?
----------------------------------------

This app was developed to take attachments from email and place them in a folder,
located on the dropbox system, using the file system.
What it morphed into was a powerful file processor....


Quick start
----------------------------------------
Build, compile and configure for an email account.
Deliver it to a folder with no filters to see the attachments come into the file system.

Building
----------------------------------------
Ensure all libaries are there in the lib folder and run the build script:

ant -f build.xml

This will build the dropbox retriever.
A list of all libraries used should be in the lib folder.


Testing
----------------------------------------
This is quite difficult - especially given the environment requirements.
If you have an email system, I suggest using a test email account, and a test dropbox folder.

Running
----------------------------------------

This is done using the run.bat/run.sh file. 
The program (DropBoxRetrieverRunner) takes one argument of a spring context file. 
The program will run each configured retriever component, applying filters in sequence.
If there is a problem, you can configure the exception handler to do something.

There is an email exception handler provided, which will email the admin or reply to the sender
of the failed email.

The email component allows domains and addresses to be blacklisted and whitelisted.



Notes...
----------------------------------------
There are some issues with the pdf convertor, jodconvertor, but these relate to OpenOffice.
For file/directory processing the test classes will allow the filters to be tested.
